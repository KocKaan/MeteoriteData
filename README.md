# Metorite Data

  This program gets Meteorite data from a source and displays it to users. The
  program is interactive When the program is executed the name of the input
  file containing the list of all the fallen meteorites is provided as the
  program's single line command line argument. The data in this file serves as
  a database of all the fallen meteorites with their name, id, nametype,
  recclass, mass,fall year,reclat,reclong and Geolocation. However this class
  only reads and stores name, id, mass,reclat and reclong. In the interactive
  part, the program should run in a loop that allows the user to issue
  different queries. The three options are Location LATITUDE LONGITUDE, year
  YEAR, mass MASS. The program will give back a a list meteorites with their
  stored information if there is a valid meteorite for that.
